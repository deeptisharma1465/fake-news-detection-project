# fake-news-detection-project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The model processes news articles and classifies them as either "Fake News" or "True News." The dataset consists of real and fake news articles, which are preprocessed, vectorized, and used to train a logistic regression model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning and tokenization)
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression model for classification
- Functionality to classify custom news articles
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/fake-news-detection)
